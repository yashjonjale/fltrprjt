This is my flutter project - Duser aka "data of user"
Disclaimer - does not work properly, has some issues
to open it:
install flutter as on the official website
create a directory for the project, intialise flutter on it
On "firebase.google.com", login and create a new project, build a realtime database by uploading the userdata.json file
install firebase cli
initialise firebase on the directory with firebase realtime database as mentioned on firebase documentation
Now, replace the lib folder with the lib folder in this repo
Now, open the project on vscode or android studio
connect your android phone with ur laptop with the usb cable
Run it on your platform.
The rest of the files are for your reference
